## Try tinkering a bit to answer the questions below

for line in line_list[1:]: # Why skip the first item?
	expenses[line[0]] = line[-1] # Why use negative indexing?
	
for site in expenses:
	print "Spent %s at %s" % (expenses[site],site)

## Be able to slice and dice data

for line in line_list[1:]:
	print line[2] # Verbally, what does this loop do? Why must we write the code this way
