#Python 1: Objects and Operators

This week we’ll start to program in Python. Python is very ‘high level,’ which means it has a ton functionality built into it that helps you code less and more readably. The downside of this is that you need to learn a larger list of items to explore python efficiently.


Python is “object oriented.” This means that it is heavily involved with the way data is structured and represented. It supports many built-in structures and allows you build your own easily.

Our first task is therefore to understand what an object is or can be, and how this is different from other elements of the programming language.

## Objects (Ch. 3 of Python Language Reference): An abstraction of data.

Every object has an identity, a type and a value

*Identity*: Constant, like a computer memory address

*Type*: Constant, determines supported operations of the object

*Value*: May change. If an object’s values can change, it is ‘mutable’

Since the type determines what you can do with an object, it is important to know
what types are built into Python. We have included a hierarchical list of common
Python types in the type_hierarchy handout. We will only be dealing with a few of these
this week: Integers, Floats, Strings, and Lists.

|Type Name| Description | Conversion | Assignment
| Integers| Whole numbers | int() | int = 2 |
| Floats | Floating point numbers | float() | flt = 2.0 |
|Strings | Ordered, immutable character set | str() | string = "hello" |
|Lists| Ordered, mutable object container | list() | list = ['a','p','r','i','l'] |


## Common String Methods

```python
.upper() # capitalize string
.lower() # make it lower case
.split(char) # split on char (a str) and return a list
.strip(char) # remove leading and trailing chars.
```

## Common List Methods

```python
.append()
.insert()
.remove()
```

##Operators

Operators are like verbs. They are pretty easy to conceptualize since their meaning in python is not really different from their meaning in math.

###Common Operators

|+ | Addition | 3+4=7 |
| -|  Subtraction | 3-4=1 |
| * | Multiplication | 4*3=12 |
| / | Division | 12/4 = 3 |
| % | Modulus | 4%3 = 1 |
| ** | Exponent | 4**3 = 64 |
| == | Equals | 3==4 |
| != | Not equals | 3!=4 | 
|> | Greater | 3>4 | 
|< | Less | 3<4 |

## The Python interpreter
Type ‘python’ at the command line. As long as python is installed, this will open the
python interpreter, which is a command line-like python environment. The prompt looks
like this: 

```python

>>> 
```

Type *Ctrl+D* to quit.

You can access documentation on most object by typing help(object). These
aren’t always that helpful, though.


## For Loops
Control the flow of your programs by iterating a command over a collection of objects. Syntax:
for item in collection:

```python
do something with item
do something else
```

“item” is automatically created as a variable by the loop, you don’t have to declare it
anywhere else.

## While Loops
Used less often than for loops because they’re not as readable and clear. But they’re
good for some things, which we may get to later. Syntax:

```python
while condition:
do something
```

Note that if condition is always True, the loop goes on forever – not always a
disaster, actually.


## List and string slicing
This bread-and-butter capability allows you to select parts of ordered objects, like
strings and lists. It takes a little getting used to, unfortunately, so make sure you get some
practice. Notation:

```python
collection[start:stop]
``` 


The first tricky thing is that computers start counting from 0, not 1.

```python
>>> string1 = “Ben”
>>> string1[0]
‘B’
```

The next oddity is that the starting position is inclusive and the stopping position is
exclusive. So the stopping number is the first position which is not included in the slice.

```python
>>> string1[0:1]
‘B’
>>> string1[0:2]
‘Be’
```

## List and string occupancy
Python can check to see if characters or objects are in lists and strings. It will return a Boolean type.

```python
>>> mystring = "Rocky 4"
>>> "4" in mystring
True
>>> 4 in mystring
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
TypeError: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand
>>> mylist = ["Rocky", 4]
>>> "4" in mylist
False
>>> 4 in mylist
True
>>> print mylist[0], mylist[1], "the best movie"
Rocky 4 the best movie

```
